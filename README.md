ABOUT
=====

This project contains my journey around the rust language.

I'm following "The Rust Book".

Each commit I make has a description of my rants. 

Initially I had big pretensions. But I've decided to make baby steps.

I'm a java developer with over 20 years of hands-on experience. 

In my last 10 years I'm focusing on java utilities and maintenance is specific java 
frameworks that allow specialist developers with little to low java knowledge to
create integrations that transfer data between integrations using multiple sources 
and targets: be them databases, web requests, csv files, xml files, and so on.

In the last year I'm focusing on placing this project into containers. 

The file [docs/journal.md](/docs/journal.md) contains my notes.

This is my brain at work, so some notes may end up in portuguese, sorry :)
