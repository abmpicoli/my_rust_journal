* `rustc` is the compiler that generates a ready to run output.
  
  it generates an executable that you can use to run the code. Automatic linker.

* `println!` is a macro.

  Rust doesn't accept functions with variable arguments.
 
  A macro can be used to parse variable arguments, either by invoking a function
  or by parsing the variable arguments itself?

  > BABY STEPS: look into it later.

* `cargo new hello_cargo` to create a new project.

------------------

Initial evaluation: Can we use Saxon from RUST?

One of the demands of my work is xml processing. Our solution is based from the end user perspective 
(that is, someone developing an integration using the java framework we have) is a typical web-app 
configuration (web.xml) that takes a properties file that contains specifications of a sequence of "processors"
to be invoked. 

The glue specifying the order between processors and the data used is XML, specifically through XSL processing XML data.

So, if this platform is to be ported in some way to rust, without causing extensive re-learning of another language than
the typical XSLT the end users are accustomed to, Rust must have something that supports XSLT. Preferably version 2 or 3.

The only tool in the market I know to support that is Saxonica's Saxon 12.

All xml libraries I've seen of rust are very incipient, not even supporting XSLT. 

And I've discovered that Saxon doesn't support Rust. 

Well. Rust supports C calls (grudgingly, dare I say?) and Saxon supports C programs. So maybe 


https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-c/documentation12/index.html#!samples/samples_c 
this can be done eventually.

I'm not too worried about environment compatibilities now because the solutions tend to be run from inside a docker environment,
with a fixed Ubuntu OS. 

WELL::: BABY STEPS !

Resuming https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html 

I've created the project inside 'chapter3_guessing_game' directory. And the insights I have are in multiple commits in code comments in the main.rs

Oct/1/2023 09:51
----------------

### rust use  ~= java import
In the last day, I did discover that what in java we call "packages" and the "import" directive are not that different (in a very first level view, mind that)

`use std::io` is not unlike `import java.io.*` in java. In the sense it is only an abbreviation of a dependency involving
methods that may be invoked without a full package reference.

`use std::io ... stdin.read` 

is equivalent to `std::io::stdin.read` 

like with java `import java.io ... InputStream i ` 

is the equivalent of `java.io.InputStream i`

### rust is not object oriented. Not in first view.

In java, even a main class is a class. the pattern is `class X { public static void main(String... args) { ... } `. Classes have constructors with specific 
invocations.

In rust, what we have are conventions: `let mut x = String::new` is not the same thing as `StringBuilder x = new StringBuilder()`.

For starters:

* the `new` in the rust code is a *convention*. I could call the constructor whatever I want. the new is only a method name commonly used to instantiate new instances.

### BIG BIG BIG difference between java and rust!

In rust, libraries are provided for common functions, so in a sense there is an "equivalent"
of the java standard API. And the java API is **HUGE**. java.io, java.util, java.text. java.sql ... And *EVERYTHING* is packaged as a single release. Java 1.8, java 9, java 10.

And for java, a java runtime must comes with every single package there as part of 
the package.

Not so with rust, it seems:

IN java, want to use the random generator? Just invoke 
```
import java.util.Random 

...

public static void main(String... args) {
	Random x = new Random();
	x = Random.nextInt();
}
```

In rust, even something as trivial as random number generation is out, and it
must be specified in the cargo.toml.

Well... rust  is not unlike C, in this aspect right? To use rand we need to
`#include <stdlib.h>`... But YES, it is different! Because the stdlib reference
is *FLOATING*: it is a reference to whatever is installed into your own computer.

Like java. Or python with that PIP install thing (at least at first view. Not a python expert).

In rust, I must specify a library *and a version* . In the cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

And only then can I use it inside the code.


UPDATE: When I've tried to simply qualify the reference to the code from inside the code, I've just discovered that rust crates are crazy!!!

If you have a code like 

```use rand::Rng

       let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

```

Obviously I could use the full reference package, like, ignore the rand::Rng 

and do something like this... Right? RIGHT?? WRONG!

```
    let secret_number = rand::Rng::rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
```

error[E0223]: ambiguous associated type
  --> src/main.rs:13:25
   |
13 |     let secret_number = <dyn rand::Rng>::rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
help: if there were a trait named `Example` with associated type `rand` implemented for `dyn Rng`, you could use the fully-qualified path

THERE IS MUCH MORE TO rust crates than only the java equivalent of "packaged classes"... Baby steps. More to come.

03/Oct/2023
-----------

The more I look into it, the more I see that there is a big concern about packaging and documentation when publishing crates (which would be traditional java jars).

The use directive mention a crate and then something inside the crate.

"Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. " : se não tem uma distribuição binária, taí porque o build seria lento.

If you look into the target directory, there is a debug/deps directory, that contains a reference to your local registry: /home/abpicoli/.cargo/registry/

E:\projetos\my_rust_journal\chapter3_guessing_game\target\debug\deps\cfg_if-52fc72e823305762.rmeta: C:\Users\Usuario\.cargo\registry\src\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\cfg-if-1.0.0\src\lib.rs

### A CRATE IS A SOURCE-CODE DISTRIBUTION!!! COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM JAVA AND THEIR MAVEN COUNTERPARTS!!


### Shadowing: 

In java, you specify the type and the variable with that name has that type, forever, in the scope of the application.

In rust, you may have multiple versions of the same variable, with different types. 

And the correct type is used depending on the context??? No, right? It seems the type is "shadowed" into a new type?

Yes, this is what happens: guess becomes a u32 variable through the rest of the code.

let mut guess = String::new();
...
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!")

### Match:

match is a switch for enumerations.

But it is more... For example, the parse() method has an Ok(number) as an option, or an Err(error message) as other option, so you must specify the content, and can use the 
parameter as useful information on responding to each case.

```
	let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
		Ok(num) => num, //just return the input number
		Err(err) => {
			println!("Bad number ! {err} {guess}"); // err =  the error message when parsing the input...
			continue;
		}
	};
```

==========

`rustup doc` has exactly the same documentation as the rust-lang site.


The rosetta stone for java and rust:
------------------------------------

|RUST | JAVA|
|`let x = 5`|`final int x = 5`|
|`let mut x = 5`|`int x = 5`|
|`const x:i32 = 5`| roughly `private static final int x = 5` |

* the const keyword represents a global variable inside a single rust file(? explanation from Oct/5th - BBABY STEPS.
* Unlike java, where final variables may be initialized during class construction, CONSTS must be evaluated at *compile time.*

* The let operator cannot be used outside a function. so, you can't quite specify (at first view from Oct/5th, BABY STEPS) 
  a "class level" mutable variable that is used in multiple functions. 
  
  So, at FIRST view, rust is quite close to a *FUNCTIONAL|PROCEDURAL* language? (More function than procedural, in fact...) BABY STEPS.
  

* The file [/ch3_1_variables_and_mutability/src/main.rs](/ch3_1_variables_and_mutability/src/main.rs) shows examples and comments regarding the usage of variables and constants in rust.

Rust and java are the same regarding scope: 

You can do stuff like this in RUST:
```
fn main() {

	let x = 5;
	{
	
		let x = 6; // can do it, same variable, inner scope, like java and c.
		println! ("{x}") // 6
	}

}
```


RUST HAS SHADOWING IN THE SAME SCOPE!!!

As long as a variable is not MUTABLE, the let keyword allow you to redefine the variable with the same name multiple times.

let x = 1
loop {
	let x = x + 1; // valid
	println!("{x}") // valid: print 2


}

Oct/6/2023
==========

Rust = Java with types: types must be known at compile type.


A string parse method has this crazy signature on rust: ```pub fn parse<F>(&self) -> Result<F, <F as FromStr>::Err>where```
(very like java generics, btw)

If we place a variable

`let x = "123".parse().expect("boom!")` , both sides of the assignment are unknown at compile time. ERROR.

So, two solutions:

`let x: u32 = "123".parse().expect("boom!")`

or make other side of the equation have the desired type
`let x = "123".parse::<u32>().expect("boom!")`

INTEGERS:
if unspecified , assumes i32.

Can be i/u(8,16,32,64,128,size)
isize / usize = architecture size : 32 bits for 32 bit machines, 64 for 64 bit machines.

Thousand separators with _

let x = 1_000 // i32
let x:u32 = 1_000 // u32.
let x = 1_000

numeric expressions may have a type as well.

let x = 1_000u128 //

0x0f hex
0o0f octal
0b11110000 binary.
0b11_110_000 binary as well. the _ may appear anywhere: it is ignored.

### RUST doesn't accept overflow (at least in debug mode).

Oct/7/2023:
===========

RUST is CRAZY! Even the lowest of the variables have "methods" assigned to them!

https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html 

With java, any operation like "is digit", would demand a different class, Character.

With Rust, all methods are assigned TO THE PRIMITIVE TYPE ITSELF!

Java:

char c = '1';
if (Character.isDigit(c)) ...

Rust:

let char c = '1'
if (c.is_digit()) ...


RUST CASTS: casts are explicit. They *DO* exist.

let c = 'A'
let cnum = c as u32

If you look at the char primitive type reference 
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html 

You will see that what would in java be a primitive type with very little that can be done with it,

has a miriad of methods that can be used.

### Match is an expression - it is a "functional" case:

```rust
let the_char:char = match char::from_u32(i_code) {
			Some(x) => x,
			None => '·'
		}; 
```

### Function pointers do exist.

As we browse the primitive types standard library, we see that the function is a pointer. We can specify variables that are functions.


### A tuple is a function signature without a function.

let tup: (u32,i32) = (123,124)

let (x,y) = tup;

// x = 123, y = 124

Tupple is also a sort of "array" : items can be accessed by index.

assert! ( tup.0 == x) // true

TUPLES can be heterogeneous. ARRAYS must be homogeneous.

### As all rust variables tuples and arrays are BOTH immutable unless explicitly set with the mut keyword.

UNLIKE JAVA, where arrays are implicitly mutable and can't be ever locked, unless we wrap the array
around a method that would return a "read-only" copy of the array.

### Composite types are LIMITED: tuple and array. DONE?


### Statements vs expressions is a HUGE concept.

At first glance, the talk about statements and expressions found in topic 3.5 in the rust language manual are somewhat moot.

But then we see stuff like

#### "`if` is an expression".

POWERFUL!

In java, if we want to make an assigment to a variable depending on a flag can be done either by a very lengthy if

JAVA:
```java

int value;
boolean condition = true;

if(condition) { 
   value = 3 ; 
 }
else {
  value = 4;
}
```

And the alternative syntax is the plain old confusing ? : statement

`value = condition?3:4;`

That will need to be refactore into the previous if if there is any more complex decision taking in the code.

IN rust. Because if is an EXPRESSION, I can simply 

`let value = if condition { 3 } else { 4 } `

And if I have extra conditions, I can keep concatenating this, forever...

`let value = if condition { if condition2 { 42 } else { 3} } else { 4} `

And of course I can make this structured, multiline, simple to read.

#### GUESS WHAT? LOOP is also an expression...

```
let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
```
BREAK can return an expression, making loop an expression as well.

RUST: break labels must have a single quote
```
'outer: loop {
   'inner: loop { 
   ...
	break 'outer;
	...
```

#### LOOP can be a dynamic expression. WHILE can't . it returns always () .https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.while.html 


#### FORS are iterator looping.. ALWAYS.

in java we can do something like this : 
for(int i=0; i < 100; ++i) ...


or this:
List<String> x = new ArrayList<>();
....

for( k : x ) // iterates over the items in the list.

RUST ONLY CONTAINS THE LATTER: loop over an iterable thing.

08/10/2023 - Understanding ownership
====================================

#### Rust deals with the heap in principle much alike java:

Two variables that demand dynamic data will have the bulk content still going into the heap.

let s1= String::from("Hello") => pointer + some metainfo goes to stack. "Hello" goes to the heap as a sequence of characters.
let s2 = s1 => s2 pointer (pointing to s1 "Hello") + some metainfo goes to stack. 

#### YOU CAN'T ASSIGN TWO VARIABLES TO THE SAME POINTER IN THE HEAP (EXCEPT in READ-ONLY ACCESS)

The latest assignment borrows the pointer making the previous variable no longer valid.

So, for functions, you may add the function as a parameter AND THEN RETURN THE SAME VARIABLE to the caller, so the caller can 'take it back'.

THAT IS WHY println! must not be a simple function! if I was to invoke a println function, I would need to invoke
something like (pseudocode)

let mut tup: (String,String) = ("Hello","World");

// would have to do that to keep tup in my own scope. At the moment I place I call a function with heap parameters,
// I lose them.


tup=println("The value of {} is {}",tup);

#### Any type can "bypass" borrowing by implementing the Copy trait (whatever that is): 
This would make a copy of the variable before sending the function, passing the full content "by value".

TO AVOID THAT IN FUNCTION CALLING, References are used. 

> TODO: I have started a project to experiment on all this concepts, but haven't done anything yet.

A call by reference '&' can be used for READ-ONLY access to a variable.

09/10/2023: Ownership experiments.
==================================

The project [borrow_experiment](/borrow_experiments) is a work in progress trying many stuff with borrowing and inferring types.

From that we learned that "Hello" is not a string, but an '&str' . 

There is more inside the code.

#### If something is immutable in Rust, It *IS* immutable.

The borrow checker makes sure that an immutable thing is KEPT as immutable, and can't be referenced later after change.

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `the_mutable_string` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable

```

10/10/2023: More ownership experiments - Structures
===================================================

The borrow checker experiment went to my satisfaction for the moment. Moving to next chapter.

10/11/2023: A new update? 
=========================

Well... "just" discovered that the toolchain was updated on Oct/3/2023. 

Now, let's go back to structs. I'm playing with the concept of structures with a probability game:

This is common in multiple games and simulation scenarios: there is a probability of an event to occur, and then a 
random event is chosen based on that probability table.

So there can be a structure like this:

|probability|event|
|-------|-----|
|0.01| "A whale falls from the sky and crashes over you. You lose (0-1000) hitpoints"|
|5.00| "As you walk through the forest, you find a brand new sword and shield! "|
|25.0| "A pack of giant rats attacks you. Prepare for an encounter!"|

Probability is a number that shows the relative chance of that event occurring comparing to the others.

That is, the chance of finding a sword and shield is (5.00 / 0.01 = 500 ) times more likely to happen than a 
whale falling from the sky.

This is what I've got so far. Tomorrow I will try to implement this with my current knowledge.

Oct/12/2023: my initial attempt with structures.
================================================

I'm committing the initial code for my structure experiment. Given a probability array
as input, A table containing odds of a specific event to happen is printed.

This have not gone through the cargo run yet, so I will watch the fireworks! :) 

### Immutability implies in making transformation functions.

In the code, I had an array of events, and I would use a for x in 0..events.len() to change
the array, (making it mutable), but I've decided not to: the array have a map function, that
returns an array transformed by a function.

UPDATE: this commit fix all the issues and place some comments:

General hints:

* Use references for 'for loops'. Borrowship will take your variable and not return it in a for loop.

  So:
  `for f in some_var { // probably wrong: it will remove your variable and never return it.`
  
  `for f in &some_var { // good: it will keep the original reference after the loop is completed.`

* REMEMBER: rust makes NO PROMOTIONS; There are no implicit return types, there are no implicit conversions from integer to floating.
* RUST is dumb regarding deducting types: it will only detect them for the most simple of assignments. Make all types explicit.

Oct/13/2023: structs *are* classes... in a way.
===============================================

Considering that you can write code like this:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```

all the elements are there: I have the data, and the methods I can use to work with that data.

What remains to be seen is how to implement inheritance, polymorphism, etc. Smells that "traits" will do that.

But even in chapter 5, there is this idea that I can make an implementation that returns "Self". That is, a "don't bother with the 
class name, just do this."

```
impl Event {

	fn new(odds: f64, text: &str) -> Self {
		Self {
			odds,
			text: String::from(text),
			min:-1.0,
			max:-1.0
		}
	}

}
```

Why would the language allow that concept, if not to implement some sort of polymorphism, where I can run this new thing to
"anything that makes noise", like in the traditional polymorphism examples?

Another question is "what about public , protected, private?"



Well, let's go to chapter 6.

### enum DEFINITELY is not our java enum.

Oct/14/2023: some hangs trying to work with the Option enum:
============================================================

Today I have finished watching the Tony Hoare meeting about the billion dollar mistake.

"The idea of using "proof" : https://youtu.be/ybrQvs4x0Ps?t=1900 appears in the middle,
where the guy seems to talk about Test Driven Development

The project ch6_enums is a work in progress for an "adventure like" game.

But I'm dealing with some hangs regarding the use of Option with the function pointer type. WIP.

Oct/15/2023: let me just move on:
=================================

The ch6 project clearly seems to show that I still don't know enough to make the "adventure game".

There are a lot of things that make me suspect the borrow checker will vanish with the data and not use it.

From chapter 7: "A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate" ? 

The exercise for chapter 7 : turn the ch6 project into a functional project, where each scene and options are inside a module.

Oct/16/2023: Rust pushes functional. Because mutable is hard to handle.
=======================================================================

In chapter 6 exercise we got a lot of trouble with mutable variables (choosing lifetimes and such).

But the point is that, at least for this adventure example, we don't need it: I can use "normal"
variables and design the application to be heavily functional.

Because _functions appear not to be affected by the borrow checker_ . After all they are code: intrinsically static
discovered at compile time. Right? Right??

Hm... demands an experiment.

So, let's think about the structures.

The game is a simple text-based adventure. 

All the player can do is to choose between up to 3 choices.

The player is in a scene, that describes what the player is seeing. What he sees will depend on the player history.

The player has Tags that shows details about the game progress. 

For example, on chapter 6, the player starts with the NAKED tag.

When we talk about choices, I have two concerns:

1) Is the choice provided applicable based on the scene and player? 
2) Once we apply the choice, we provide player and scene, and receive a new player and scene.

So a player has tags. To make it simple, tags will be simple strings, separated by semicolons;

Some helper methods may be used to ask if a player has a tag has_tag

Remove a tag remove_tag; 

and add_tag; 

a pretty_print tag will be used to "pretty print" the possessions. In the beginning it will be only a simple string.



The scene will have 

describe(&Player) : providing descriptions based on player tags.

choices: an array of 3 Choice elements.

A choice will have:

fn is_applicable(Scene,Player) -> boolean : 

fn apply(Scene,Player) -> (Scene,Player) 

fn describe(Player) -> String : describes the scene to the player.

NOTE: I'm also looking at chapter 11 (tests) : I can't possibly go on without some test driven development :D 

Day close: as expected, even the simplest code has lots of fireworks :( 

Committing code at state: it is not even compiling yet.

Oct/17/2023: Rust **IS** A **PAIN** IN THE **ASSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
=======================================================================

In any language in the WORLD... 

return a string concatenated with other string would be a simple concatenation operation. One liner.

So, this function which is a one liner in java, can be written in rust, right? RIGHT??

```
pub fn format_tag(tag:&str) {
	"♦ " + tag + "\n" 
	
}
```

NOT SO WITH RUST:


abpicoli@DESKTOP-EPFPMPH:/mnt/e/projetos/my_rust_journal/ch7_modules$ cargo test player.rs
   Compiling ch7_modules v0.1.0 (/mnt/e/projetos/my_rust_journal/ch7_modules)
error[E0369]: cannot add `&str` to `&str`
  --> src/player.rs:13:7
   |
13 |     "♦ " + tag + "\n"
   |     ---- ^ --- &str
   |     |    |
   |     |    `+` cannot be used to concatenate two `&str` strings
   |     &str
   |
   = note: string concatenation requires an owned `String` on the left
help: create an owned `String` from a string reference
   |
13 |     "♦ ".to_owned() + tag + "\n"
   |         +++++++++++

So, let's satisfy the rust compiler. Let's make a String::from in the first content:

```
pub fn format_tag(tag:&str)->String {
	String::from("♦ ") + tag + "\n" 
	
}
```

This have returned a string. And as consequences, the raw data from the string is useless for many operations, such as an replace operation.

So, all over the code, I need to do stunts like this:

format_tag(NAKED).to_owned()+&format_tag(RAGGED_CLOTHING)


Well... tomorrow I will work with the other modules.

Oct/18/2023: 
============

Hm... yesterday I did this stunt. Probably because I was crazy with the str x string confusion.

```
	pub fn add_tag(self,tag:&str) -> Player {
		if ! self.contains_tag(tag) {
			let mut x:String = self.tags.clone();
			x.push_str(&format_tag(tag));
			return Player {
				tags:x.clone()
			}
		}
		self
	}
```

But... I think this is legal, and much cleaner, right?

``` 
	pub fn add_tag(self,tag:&str) -> Player {
		if ! self.contains_tag(tag) {
			let x = self.tags.clone() + &format_tag(tag);
			return Player {
				tags:x
			}
		}
		self
	}
```

What does the operator "add" does to a string? 

And Rust documentation *does* have the answer: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#impl-Add%3C%26str%3E-for-String 

The problem with concatenation is that it will always "consume" the left operator.
x + y = x.add(y) , which implies a call to x(self,y) . 

Well... just compiled the change in player.rs and... no issues. Ok. 

AND... in the end the big problem is that I'm probably doing things *the complicated way*.

I bet the macro concat! https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.concat.html will be much more efficient,

and simpler to use.

Let's try it:

from 
```
pub fn format_tag(tag:&str)->String{
	let x = String::from("♦ ") + tag + "\n" ;
	x
}
```
to 
```
pub fn format_tag(tag:&str)->String{
	String::from(concat!("♦ ",tag,"\n"))
}
```

There is no happiness :( 

```
error: expected a literal
  --> src/player.rs:13:28
   |
13 |     String::from(concat!("♦ ",tag,"\n"))
   |                               ^^^
   |
   = note: only literals (like `"foo"`, `-42` and `3.14`) can be passed to `concat!()`

e
```

and guess what what the add operator is , behind the covers??

```
https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/string.rs.html#2265
 fn add(mut self, other: &str) -> String {
        self.push_str(other);
        self
    }
```

So, specially for multiple c, it may be better to simply push_str. Avoid a stack call

Oct/19/2023
===========

I'm working on the choice.rs today. Because a scene needs a choice.

A choice 

A choice will have:

fn is_applicable(Scene,Player) -> boolean : 

fn apply(Scene,Player) -> (Scene,Player) 

fn describe(Player) -> String : describes the choice to the player.

The choice seems to be a set of functions, right? Smells like these "Traits" concept?

Well... let's just try making the structure, made of function pointers.

Ans THIS is the suspense point: I'm committing this code. Will it compile?

```
abpicoli@DESKTOP-EPFPMPH:/mnt/e/projetos/my_rust_journal/ch7_modules$ cargo run

```

Yep it did.


Now, how do I create multiple choices? Probably with a constructor... Because I don't think I can use "const" for declaring a choice.

Well, more for tomorrow.

Oct/20/2023:
============

Well... the idea of making a struct containing pointers to functions *works*... barely and awkwardly.

Sure, you can specify a struct containing pointers to functions.

But the function itself is hardcoded at compile time, so you can't create a struct with some "anonymous definition". You must 
explicitly point to an existing function in code, by name.

Also, invoking this function pointed by the struct is also awkward, having to place the field inside parenthesis ...

So, yes. Let's move to next chapter and skip this ch7 project.

Oct/21/2023:
============

Reading chapter 8 about collections.

And it seems the borrow checker attacks again...

```
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0];

    v.push(6); // BOOOM!!!!

    println!("The first element is: {first}");
```

Because of the borrow checker system, vectors are *implicitly synchronized*! So the stunts we must
do with java when having a vector changed in multiple threads (Concurrent modification exception)
will happen at the very beginning of an operation...

Which means I must for sure use something else to allow multiple threads to modify the same vector without giving 
a compile time error, right??

More to see when we try async operations later.

**BIG TAKEAWAY: STRINGS ARE COMPLICATED** : Strings are a vector of characters, but to support all internationalization,
diacritics, chinese characters, and so on, you can only iterate through the string, and not access a specific character by index.

FOR TOMORROW: make the tests for the exercise at the summary of chapter 8

Oct/23/2023:
============

Did take a look into the "Rust Drama". 

Starting looking into the first exercise of chapter 8

Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.

The list of integers will be provided by user input. A line containing numbers separated by spaces.

The project ch8_1_median contains the initial output of the exercise. 

Oct/24/2023: 
============

Made some strides in ch_8_1. Decided to order the steps in the main method as functions so they can be tested in isolation with multiple use cases.

This manual input is tedious.

Oct/25/2023:
============

Ended up looking at rust forums. So, yes, rust is much more like C++ than anything else regarding portability.

Just discovered the magical into() method that converts one type to another implicitly.

In the rust library there is this concept of "blanket implementations". Need to see that later.

First median test working.

Borrow check is a b*tch: 

This doesn't work, because x was borrowed when placed into the first item.

(x,y)=(x,x[y].into())

```
  --> src/main.rs:45:23
   |
39 | pub fn median(the_vector:Vec<u32>) -> (Vec<u32>,f64) {
   |               ---------- move occurs because `the_vector` has type `Vec<u32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
45 |         return (the_vector, the_vector[vec_len / 2 ].into());
   |                 ----------  ^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
   |                 |
   |                 value moved here
   |
```
The solution? Assign the expression in the step before into a variable.

Oct/26/2023:
============

Keep working on the chapter 8: median.

A reinforcement on the mut keyword: the mut keyword declares INTENT. It says *i want to change a variable*.

Because of that it makes sense in variable declarations and function declarations. 

It doesn't make sense on function results, because what people want to do with the outcome of a function
is out of scope of the function.

Today I had to review once more chapter 4.

If you want a complex type to mutate in content inside the code, you must specify that the parameter is a mutable reference (&mut) 
and then specify when calling the function that you are passing a mutable reference to the variable.

So...

fn median(the_vector: **&mut** Vec<u32>) -> f64 {
  the_vector.sort_unstable(); // a mutable reference can be referred directly inside the function. No "&" or "*".
}

...

x : mut Vec<u32>=vec![1,2,3,4,5];

let the_median = median( **&mut** x)

Oct/27/2023:
============

Completed exercise 8.1 - mode / median. 

Starting exercise 8.2 - piglatin

Tried to find a library to check if a vowel is such in romance languages. Couldn't find any implementation that has
an actually exhaustive value. So I will keep it simple, and only consider vowels "AEIOUaeiou"

Rust concerns with internationalization are a bitch .

char.to_lowercase is not a single char! It is a lowercase structure, that may contain more than one character. Crazy! 

How I miss 1980s old 127 characters ascii :D .

============

How to run the debugger for tests (using Windows Ubuntu WSL).

1) make sure you have gdb installed. (sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get gdb )

2) the program rust-gdb allows to debug source code. The program to use to debug tests is `rust-gdb`.

The test output will show a line containing the binary that failed.

```
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/debug/deps/ch8_2_piglatin-03717bc444e3dfba)
```

Once it's found, you can start rust-gdb with that file.

```
rust-gdb target/debug/deps/ch8_2_piglatin-03717bc444e3dfba
```


Borrow checkers are a pain in the ass! Again.
